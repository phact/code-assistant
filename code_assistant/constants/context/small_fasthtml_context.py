## Objective: 
Build a FastHTML app. 

## FastHTML Basics:

FastHTML is a NEW python web application framework, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH FASTAPI.

Here's a very basic, fully functional hello world which we'll break down:

```python
from fasthtml.common import *

app = FastHTML()
rt = app.route


@rt('/')
def get():
    return Div('Hello, World!')

serve()
```

### Application Setup:

Initialize a FastHTML app using app = FastHTML(hdrs=(picolink, css)).
Define routes using a shorthand 


```
rt = app.route

@rt('/')
def get():
    ...
```

### HTMX

FastHTML uses htmx for dynamic content updates. Aim to use HTMX for dynamic content updates and avoid using JS for DOM manipulation.

### Function Naming and Routes:

To crate routes always define HTTP method functions with the name of the HTTP method (get, post) and
Use @app.route('/') to apply routes, handling HTTP GET requests for rendering pages.

Always create a route for the root path ('/') to serve the main page of the app. 
If the app isn't loading properly check the route for the root path and  ensure it returns an FT with valid syntax.

```
rt = app.route

@rt('/')
def get():
    return Div('Hello, World!') # Note the div will automatically get converted to HTML and will be placed inside the body tag
    ...

@rt('/other-endpoint')
def post():
    ...
```
    
or alternatively using the app.get, app.post decorators:

```
@app.post('/vehicle/')
def select_vehicle(choice: str):
    ...
```
### HTML Structure:

FastHTML uses FastTags (known as FTs) these are python representations of HTML elements (e.g., Div, Button, Span). IMPORTANT, only the first letter is capitalized (i.e. use Hr, Tr, Th, etc not HR, TR, TH).

Here are all the available tags:

['Html', 'Safe', 'Head', 'Title', 'Meta' ,'Link', 'Style', 'Body', 'Pre', 'Code', 'Div', 'Span', 'P', 'H1', 'H2', 'H3', 'H4', 'H5', 'H6', 'Strong',
           'Em', 'B', 'I', 'U', 'S', 'Strike', 'Sub', 'Sup', 'Hr', 'Br', 'Img', 'A', 'Nav', 'Ul', 'Ol', 'Li', 'Dl',
           'Dt', 'Dd', 'Table', 'Thead', 'Tbody', 'Tfoot', 'Tr', 'Th', 'Td', 'Caption', 'Col', 'Colgroup', 'Form',
           'Input', 'Textarea', 'Button', 'Select', 'Option', 'Label', 'Fieldset', 'Legend', 'Details', 'Summary',
           'Main', 'Header', 'Footer', 'Section', 'Article', 'Aside', 'Figure', 'Figcaption', 'Mark', 'Small', 'Iframe',
           'Object', 'Embed', 'Param', 'Video', 'Audio', 'Source', 'Canvas', 'Svg', 'Math', 'Script', 'Noscript',
           'Template', 'Slot']

The various tags live in fasthtml.common and are imported using:

```
from fasthtml.common import *
```

Always import * from fasthtml.common rather than doing individual imports

HTML attributes can be set using named python arguments. For example, to set the class attribute of a Div element:

```
Div(cls='my-class')
```

You can nest FastTags inside each other using positional python arguments in order to create complex HTML structures. 

Remember to include positional arguments (i.e. other FTs) before you include any keyword arguments (i.e. attrs).
 
The following example is incorrect:

```
def get():
    return Div(cls='my-class', Div('inner div')) 
```

It will return following runtime error: `positional argument follows keyword argument`

```
def get():
    return Div(Div('inner div'), cls='my-class')
```

Use semantic elements like Nav, Header, Form, Section to organize content.

Ensure that FT children elements are passed as positional arguments to parent tags:

Correct:

```
Form(
    Button('one'),
    Button('two'),
    Button('three'),
    id="my-form"
)
```

or 

```
buttons = [Button(str(i)) for i in range(1, 4)]
Form(id="my-form", *buttons) # Form(buttons) or Form(children=buttons) WILL NOT WORK
```

If you need to pass attributes BEFORE children FTs, you can do it like so:

```
Form(id="my-form")(*buttons)
```

Remember, attributes are positional arguments.


## Style and Script

You can include CSS and JS in your FastHTML app using the Style and Script FTs. This includes adding js libraries using a CDN.

for example:

```python
threejs = Script(src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"),
style = Style('body { background-color: lightblue; }')
script = Script('''
var scene = new THREE.Scene();
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
camera.position.z = 4;

var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({antialias:true});
renderer.setClearColor("#000000");
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: "#433F81" } );
var cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( cube );

var render = function () {
  requestAnimationFrame( render );

  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
};

render();
''')

app = FastHTML(hdrs=(style, script))
```

IMPORANT Style and Script take a string as their first argument, which is the content of the style or script tag.
and the scripts need to go in hdrs=(...) in the FastHTML constructor.

## Request Parameters

When you specify arguments to a route, FastHTML will search the request for values with the same name, and convert them to the correct type. 
IMPORTANT you must use type hints for these arguments.

In order, it searches:
 - The path parameters
 - The query parameters
 - The cookies
 - The headers
 - The session
 - Form data
 
There are also a few special arguments:
 - request (or any prefix like req): gets the raw Starlette Request object
 - session (or any prefix like sess): gets the session object
 - auth
 - htmx
 - app
In this section letâ€™s quickly look at some of these in action.

### Path Parameters:
When passing path parameters to a route, use the same name as the parameter in the path and always use type hints.

For example, this route:
```
@app.post('/thing/{id}')
def select_vehicle(id: str): # NOTICE the type hint for id, this is required or the variable will be set to None
    ...
```

Will accept the request made by the HTML generated by this FT:

```
Button(cls='btn', hx_post=f'/thing/my_thing_id', hx_swap="none")
```

### Query Parameters:
When passing query parameters to a route, make sure your parameter names match and always use type hints.

For example, this route:
```
@app.post('/thing')
def select_vehicle(id: str): # NOTICE the type hint for id, this is required or the variable will be set to None
    ...
```

Will accept the request made by the HTML generated by this FT:

```
Button(cls='btn', hx_post=f'/thing_id?id=my_thing_id', hx_swap="none")
```

### Body Parameters:

For POST routes you can also use body parameters but you must use a Form in the html.

You can use starlette request object to get the form data.

For example when submitting the following form (FT):

```
Form(Input(id='id', type='text'), Button('Submit'), hx_post='/thing_id')
```

Extract the values from the request object in the route function:

```
@app.post('/thing_id')
def select_vehicle(request): # NOTICE the type hint for id, this is required or the variable will be set to None
    form_obj = await request.form()
    id = form_obj['id']
    print(f'the id is {id}')
    ...
```


Alternatively (this shorthand is preffered), you can specify the variable name AND TYPE HINT in the route function arguments and FastHTML will automatically extract the values.

```
@app.post('/thing_id')
def select_vehicle(id: str): # NOTICE the type hint for id, this is required or the variable will be set to None
    print(f'the id is {id}')
    ...
```

Remember, the id attribute of the input tag(s) must match the parameter name(s) in the route.

### With inputs, checkboxes, or radio buttons

Note, to get the values of inputs you must put them in a Form with the Button that triggers the request and make sure the id of the input matches the parameter name in the route.


```
@rt("/context")
async def get(option_one: str = None, option_two: str = None, option_three: str = None): # NOTICE the type hints these are required or the variables will be set to None
    if option_one == 'on':
        ...
```


```
    Form(
        Div(
            Label(
                "Option One",
                Input(
                    id="option_one",
                    name="option_one",
                    type="checkbox",
                    checked=False
                ),
                for_="option_one"
            ),
            Label(
                "Option Two",
                Input(
                    id="option_two",
                    name="option_two",
                    type="checkbox",
                    checked=True
                ),
                for_="option_two"
            ),
            ...
            ),
        ),
        hx_trigger="change", hx_encoding='multipart/form-data', hx_get='/context', hx_swap="none",
    ),
```


### Static Files:

FastHTML uses starlette's path syntax, and adds a `static` type which matches standard static file extensions.
This means that FastHTML will by default serve static files from the directory from which the app is run.


### Serving the Application:

Use serve() with no arguments to start the application server directly, without conditionals or arguments. 
serve is a function that can be imported from FastHTML.common. It does not take any arguments. It is not a method of the FastHTML class.

## A Minimal Charting Application

The [`Script`](https://AnswerDotAI.github.io/fasthtml/api/xtend.html#script)
function allows you to include JavaScript. You can use Python to
generate parts of your JS or JSON like this:

``` python
import json
from fasthtml.common import * 

app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=(Script(src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.32.0.min.js"),))

data = json.dumps({
    "data": [{"x": [1, 2, 3, 4],"type": "scatter"},
            {"x": [1, 2, 3, 4],"y": [16, 5, 11, 9],"type": "scatter"}],
    "title": "Plotly chart in FastHTML ",
    "description": "This is a demo dashboard",
    "type": "scatter"
})


@rt("/")
def get():
  return Titled("Chart Demo", Div(id="myDiv"),
    Script(f"var data = {data}; Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data);"))

serve()
```

### Common Errors to Avoid:

Ensure all parentheses are properly matched.
Use cls= instead of _class= for applying CSS classes. Multiple classes can be assigned in a single argument cls="class1 class2"

Import necessary modules correctly and avoid redundancy in code.

Make sure to properly use " and ' in fstrings i.e. f"{dict['puppies']}" is correct. f'{dict['puppies']}' is incorrect.

# - Some are FastHTML symbols:
#    Beforeware, fast_app, SortableJS, fill_form, picolink, serve,

    # This is automatically called by FastHTML to convert the `Todo` objects into `FT` objects when needed.
    # The reason we put the todo list inside a form is so that we can use the 'sortable' js library to reorder them.

    # A handler can return either a single `FT` object or string, or a tuple of them.

# they are passed as form data. By using a parameter called (e.g) "id", FastHTML will try to find
# something suitable in the request with this name. In order, it searches as follows:
# path; query; cookies; headers; session keys; form data.
# Although all these are provided in the request as strings, FastHTML will use your parameter's type
# annotation to try to cast the value to the requested type.
# In the case of form data, there can be multiple values with the same key. So in this case,
# the parameter is a list of ints.
